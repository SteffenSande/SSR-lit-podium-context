Vite Challenges

- SSR for lit very challenging
    - its very hard to get server and client to hydrate without bundling server as well as client
    - vite ssr api surface challenging
- Not able to turn of chunk splitting


Learnings
- Partially unbundled development mode is a very cool idea. Essentially, intercept urls for assets and rewrite them to raw files and on the fly esbuilds.
    Eg. bare imports are handled and bundled up on the fly from node_modules 
    Since, node_modules wont change often, you can cache these mini bundles
    Local files are all served basically raw and so when they change they are immediately up to date

- Esbuild could be used to bundle code on the fly for SSR
